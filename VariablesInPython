In Python, variables are fundamental components used to store and manipulate data. 

1. What is a Variable?
A variable is a symbolic name that is bound to a value. In Python, variables are used to hold data that can be manipulated throughout a program. They act as placeholders for data.

2. Variable Assignment
Variables are created and assigned values using the = operator.

Examples:
x = 10
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.14159
Here, x, name, and pi are variables assigned the values 10, "Alice", and 3.14159, respectively.

3. Naming Rules
Python variable names must follow these rules:

* Start with a letter or an underscore (_): Variable names cannot begin with a digit.
* Followed by letters, digits, or underscores: Variable names can include letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
* Case-sensitive: variable, Variable, and VARIABLE are considered different variables.
* Cannot be a reserved keyword: Keywords like if, else, while, class, etc., cannot be used as variable names.
Examples of valid variable names:

user_age
total_price
is_active
_user_name
maxValue
Examples of invalid variable names:


2nd_variable      # Starts with a digit
my-variable       # Contains a hyphen
user name         # Contains a space
total$amount      # Contains a special character ($)
